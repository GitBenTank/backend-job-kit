# Day [N]: [Brief Title]

## Overview

[One to two sentences describing the goal of the day. What were we trying to accomplish?]

## The Real-World Problem

[Explain the actual problem this solves in production systems. Why does this matter beyond just "learning"? Connect it to real backend engineering challenges.]

## What Was Built

[Concise bullet points of what was implemented. Keep it factual and specific.]

- 
- 
- 

## Key Backend Concepts

[Explain the important concepts in simple but accurate terms. Focus on "why" these patterns exist, not just "how" to use them. Assume the reader understands programming but may not have deep context on these specific tools or patterns.]

### [Concept 1]

[Clear explanation of what it is and why it matters in backend systems.]

### [Concept 2]

[Clear explanation of what it is and why it matters in backend systems.]

## What Tripped Me Up

[Be honest about blockers, mistakes, or confusion. Explain how you resolved it. This demonstrates problem-solving and learning ability.]

### [Issue 1]

[What happened, why it happened, and how it was fixed.]

## How This Scales in Real Systems

[Connect today's work to production systems. What would this look like at scale? What are the tradeoffs? What would need to change?]

## What's Next

[Brief look ahead to the next day's work. Sets context for the learning progression.]
